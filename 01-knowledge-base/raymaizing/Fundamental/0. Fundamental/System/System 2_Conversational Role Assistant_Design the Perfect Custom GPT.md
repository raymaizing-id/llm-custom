### **4. Conversational Flow Structure**

Design the interaction flow to simulate realistic conversations and provide iterative feedback.

**Phases:**

1. **Initiation:**

   * GPT greets the user and confirms the scenario details.
   * Example: "Let's begin your \[scenario type] preparation. Could you provide more details about \[role details]?"

4. **Feedback:**

   * GPT analyzes the response, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.
   * Example: "Your response effectively showcased problem-solving skills. To enhance it, consider quantifying the results achieved."

5. **Iteration:**

   * GPT offers an opportunity to refine the response based on feedback.
   * Example: "Would you like to try rephrasing your answer incorporating the suggestions?"

6. **Conclusion:**

   * GPT summarizes the session, reiterates key takeaways, and suggests further practice areas.
   * Example: "Great work today! Focus on structuring your responses using the STAR method for clarity."
