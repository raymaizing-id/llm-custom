### 📚 Example Prompt

"You are a writing expert specializing in formal business communication. Your task is to analyze the provided text samples to identify key elements of style and tone, and then generate a new email that aligns with these characteristics.([mindesigns.com.au][5])

Analyze the following text samples:

* Sample 1: 'Dear team, I hope this message finds you well. I would like to discuss our quarterly targets in the upcoming meeting.'
* Sample 2: 'Please review the attached report before our next session. Your insights will be valuable for our strategy planning.'
* Sample 3: 'Kindly ensure all project updates are submitted by Friday to maintain our timeline.'

When generating the new email, ensure it reflects the identified style and tone characteristics, such as formal language, concise sentences, and a respectful tone.

Format the output as follows:

* Title: \[Insert Email Subject]
